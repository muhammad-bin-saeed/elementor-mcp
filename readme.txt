Extends the WordPress MCP Adapter to expose Elementor data, widgets, and page design tools as MCP tools for AI agents.

== Description ==

MCP Tools for Elementor bridges the gap between AI tools and Elementor page design. It extends the official WordPress MCP Adapter to expose 70 MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools that let AI agents like Claude, Cursor, and other MCP-compatible clients create and manipulate Elementor page designs programmatically.

**Key Features:**

* **Query & Discovery** — List widgets, inspect page structures, read element settings, browse templates, and view global design tokens.
* **Page Management** — Create pages, update page settings, clear content, import/export templates.
* **Layout Tools** — Add flexbox containers, move/remove/duplicate elements.
* **Widget Tools** — 41 widget tools: universal add/update for any widget, plus 23 free convenience shortcuts and 16 conditional Pro widget tools.
* **Pro Widget Support** — Conditional tools for Elementor Pro widgets (form, posts grid, countdown, price table, flip box, animated headline, call to action, slides, testimonial carousel, price list, gallery, share buttons, table of contents, blockquote, Lottie, hotspot) that only register when Pro is active.
* **Template Tools** — Save pages or elements as reusable templates, apply templates to pages.
* **Global Settings** — Update site-wide color palettes and typography presets.
* **Composite Tools** — Build a complete page from a declarative JSON structure in a single call.
* **Stock Images** — Search Openverse for Creative Commons images, sideload into Media Library, add to pages.
* **SVG Icons** — Upload SVG icons from URL or raw markup for use with Elementor icon widgets.
* **Custom Code** — Add custom CSS (element/page level), inject JavaScript, create site-wide code snippets for head/body injection.
* **Sample Prompts** — 5 ready-to-use landing page blueprints with one-click copy from the admin dashboard.
* **Admin Dashboard** — Toggle individual tools on/off, view connection configs for all supported MCP clients, and browse/copy sample prompts.

**Requires:**

* WordPress 6.8 or later
* Elementor 3.20 or later (container support required)
* WordPress MCP Adapter plugin
* WordPress Abilities API (bundled in WP 6.9+)

**Connection Methods:**

* WP-CLI stdio (recommended for local development)
* Node.js HTTP proxy (for remote sites)
* Direct HTTP (for VS Code MCP extension)

4. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
5. Go to **Settings > MCP Tools for Elementor** to configure tools and view connection info.

= WP-CLI Connection (Local) =

Add to your MCP client configuration:

`
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "elementor-mcp": {
      "command": "wp",
      "args": ["mcp-adapter", "serve", "--server=elementor-mcp-server", "--user=admin", "--path=/path/to/wordpress"]

`
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "elementor-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["bin/mcp-proxy.mjs"],
      "env": {
        "WP_URL": "https://your-site.com",

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is MCP? =

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open standard that allows AI tools to interact with external services. This plugin exposes Elementor's page building capabilities as MCP tools.

= Does this plugin work without Elementor Pro? =

Yes. Core widget tools work with free Elementor. Pro widget shortcuts (form, posts grid, countdown, price table, flip box, animated headline) only register when Elementor Pro is active.

= Can I disable specific tools? =

Yes. Go to Settings > MCP Tools for Elementor > Tools tab to toggle individual tools on or off.

= Does this plugin require the WordPress MCP Adapter? =

Yes. The MCP Adapter handles the MCP protocol transport layer. This plugin registers its tools through the Adapter's server infrastructure.

= Is this plugin safe to use on production sites? =

The plugin enforces WordPress capability checks on every tool. Read operations require `edit_posts`, write operations check `edit_post` ownership, and global settings require `manage_options`. All input is sanitized and validated.
